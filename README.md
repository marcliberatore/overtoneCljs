# overtoneCljs

An example Clojure application showing [Noir] (since deprecated, use [lib-noir] instead), [ClojureScript], several of [ibdknox]'s ([Chris Granger]'s) libraries, and [Overtone] all together. For the wub wub!

## Prerequisites

Tested with [Leiningen] 2.0.0.

[Leiningen]:https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Usage

To use the wub wub machine, invoke:

```bash
lein run
```

Wait for Overtone to download the piano samples (which will take a while) and then point your JavaScript-enabled web browser at http://localhost:8080 after you get the message

    Server started on port [8080].
    You can view the site at http://localhost:8080

If you make changes to the ClojureScript file, located in `src-cljs/overtoneinterface/client/main.cljs`, you'll need to recompile it separately via `lein cljsbuild once` or `lein cljsbuild auto`. 

## TODO

- Move away from deprecated or relatively unmaintained libraries (Noir, fetch)
- Fix any additional dependency clashes
- Whatever your wub wub heart desires
